Certainly! Hereâ€™s the C code with meaningful comments followed by an explanation:

```c
#include <stdio.h>   // Includes the standard input/output library, needed for printf function
#include <stdbool.h> // Includes the library to use boolean data types like 'bool', 'true', and 'false'

int main() {
    bool isTrue = true;  // Declares a boolean variable 'isTrue' and initializes it with 'true'
    
    // Prints the boolean value. In C, 'true' is represented as 1 and 'false' as 0.
    printf("Boolean value: %d\n", isTrue);
    
    return 0;  // Returns 0 to indicate that the program executed successfully
}
```

### Explanation

1. **`#include <stdio.h>`**: This line includes the standard input/output library, which provides the `printf` function used for printing output to the console.

2. **`#include <stdbool.h>`**: This line includes the header file that defines the `bool` data type and the constants `true` and `false`. It allows you to use boolean values in your code.

3. **`int main()`**: The main function where the program execution starts. It returns an integer value to the operating system.

4. **`bool isTrue = true;`**: This line declares a variable `isTrue` of type `bool` and initializes it with the value `true`. In C, `true` and `false` are predefined constants in `<stdbool.h>`.

5. **`printf("Boolean value: %d\n", isTrue);`**: This line prints the value of the boolean variable `isTrue`. In C, the `bool` type is represented as `int` where `true` is displayed as `1` and `false` as `0`. `%d` is used as the format specifier for integers.

6. **`return 0;`**: This statement signifies the end of the `main` function and returns `0` to the operating system, indicating that the program executed successfully without any errors.
