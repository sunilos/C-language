Here's the C code with comments added to explain each part:

```c
#include <stdio.h>  // Preprocessor directive to include the standard input/output library

// Function prototype declaration for 'greet'
void greet();

int main() {
    // Calling the 'greet' function
    greet();
    return 0;  // Return 0 to indicate that the program ended successfully
}

// Function definition for 'greet'
void greet() {
    // Print a message to the console
    printf("Hello from a declared function!\n");
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **`#include <stdio.h>`**: This line tells the compiler to include the Standard Input Output library before the actual compilation begins. This library is necessary for using functions like `printf()` which is used to print text to the console.

2. **`void greet();`**: This is a function prototype. It declares that there is a function named `greet` that takes no arguments and returns no value (`void`). This tells the compiler that the function `greet` exists and will be defined later in the code.

3. **`int main()`**: This is the main function where the program starts execution. Every C program must have a `main` function. It returns an integer, with `0` typically indicating that the program ran successfully.

4. **`greet();`**: Inside the `main` function, this line calls the `greet` function. When `greet` is called, the program jumps to the `greet` function's definition and executes the code inside it.

5. **`return 0;`**: This line indicates that the `main` function is returning a value of `0` to the operating system. This is a conventional way to signal that the program has completed successfully.

6. **`void greet()`**: This is the definition of the `greet` function. It specifies that `greet` takes no parameters and returns no value.

7. **`printf("Hello from a declared function!\n");`**: Inside the `greet` function, this line prints the string `"Hello from a declared function!\n"` to the console. The `\n` is a newline character that moves the cursor to the next line after printing the string.

The comments and explanations aim to clarify the purpose and functionality of each part of the code for better understanding.
