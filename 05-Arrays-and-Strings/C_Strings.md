### **1. Code without comments:**
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char str[] = "Hello, World!";

    printf("String: %s\n", str);

    return 0;
}
```

### **2. Code with comments and explanations:**
```c
#include <stdio.h>  // Includes the standard input-output library for input-output functions

int main() {  // Main function where the program execution starts
    char str[] = "Hello, World!";  // Declares and initializes a character array with the string "Hello, World!"

    // Prints the string using the %s format specifier for strings
    printf("String: %s\n", str);  // Outputs the string to the console

    return 0;  // Returns 0, indicating successful program execution
}
```

### Explanation

- `#include <stdio.h>` is included to use the `printf` function, which is part of the standard input-output library.
- The `main` function is the starting point of the program.
- A character array `str[]` is declared and initialized with the string `"Hello, World!"`.
- The `printf` function is used to print the string, using the `%s` format specifier.
- The program ends with `return 0;`, which signals the operating system that the program has executed successfully.
