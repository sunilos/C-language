Hereâ€™s the C code with concise comments and a brief explanation:

```c
#include <stdio.h>  // Includes the standard input-output library for input-output functions

int main() {  // Main function where execution starts
    printf("Hello, World!\n");  // Prints "Hello, World!" with a newline

    return 0;  // Returns 0 to indicate successful execution
}
```

### Explanation

1. **`#include <stdio.h>`**: Includes the library for input-output functions like `printf`.

2. **`int main()`**: Main function where the program execution begins.

3. **`printf("Hello, World!\n");`**: Outputs the string "Hello, World!" followed by a newline character.

4. **`return 0;`**: Signals that the program has executed successfully.
