Sure, hereâ€™s the C code with minimal comments and a brief explanation, continuing in the same style:

```c
#include <stdio.h>  // Includes the standard input-output library for input-output operations

int main() {  // Main function where the program execution begins
    printf("Getting Started with C!\n");  // Prints the string "Getting Started with C!"

    return 0;  // Returns 0 to indicate successful program execution
}
```

### Explanation

1. **`#include <stdio.h>`**: Includes the standard library for input and output functions, such as `printf`.

2. **`int main()`**: The main function where the program begins its execution.

3. **`printf("Getting Started with C!\n");`**: Outputs the message "Getting Started with C!" to the console, with a newline at the end.

4. **`return 0;`**: Returns 0 to signal that the program has finished successfully.
