### **1. Code without comments:**
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int i = 0;

    while (i < 5) {
        printf("i: %d\n", i);
        i++;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### **2. Code with comments and explanations:**
```c
#include <stdio.h>

/**
 * @brief The main function demonstrates the use of a while loop in C.
 * 
 * This function uses a while loop to print the value of the integer variable 'i' from 0 to 4.
 * The loop continues until the condition `i < 5` is no longer true.
 * 
 * @return int Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
 */
int main() {
    int i = 0;  /**< Integer variable initialized to 0. */

    // While loop to print the value of 'i' as long as 'i' is less than 5
    while (i < 5) {
        printf("i: %d\n", i);  /**< Print the current value of 'i'. */
        i++;                   /**< Increment 'i' by 1 after each iteration. */
    }

    return 0;   /**< Return 0 to indicate successful execution. */
}
```

### Explanation

- The `#include <stdio.h>` directive includes the Standard I/O library, which provides functions like `printf` for output.
- The `main` function is the entry point of the program.
- An integer variable `i` is declared and initialized to `0`.
- The `while` loop continues to execute as long as the condition `i < 5` is true.
  - Inside the loop, the current value of `i` is printed.
  - After printing, `i` is incremented by `1` to move to the next value.
- The loop stops when `i` reaches `5`, making the condition `i < 5` false.
- The program concludes with `return 0;`, indicating that the program has run successfully and returning control to the operating system.
