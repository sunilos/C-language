Here is the two-part output for the provided code:

### **1. Code without comments:**
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Getting Started with C!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

### **2. Code with comments and explanations:**
```c
#include <stdio.h>  // Includes the standard input-output library for input-output operations

int main() {  // Main function where the program execution begins

    // Prints the message "Getting Started with C!" to the console
    printf("Getting Started with C!\n");  // %s format specifier for strings not needed as it's a direct string literal
    
    return 0;  // Returns 0, indicating successful program execution
}
```

### **Five key points explained:**
1. **Standard I/O Library**: `#include <stdio.h>` includes the standard I/O functions like `printf` and `scanf`, enabling input and output operations.
2. **Program Entry Point**: `int main()` is the main function where the execution of the program begins.
3. **Printing to Console**: The `printf("Getting Started with C!\n");` prints the string literal "Getting Started with C!" and moves to a new line using `\n`.
4. **Direct String Literal**: Since the message is a direct string literal, format specifiers like `%s` are not required.
5. **Return Statement**: `return 0;` indicates that the program completed successfully and returns control to the operating system.
