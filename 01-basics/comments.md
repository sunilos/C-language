Here is the second version of the code with comments and a brief explanation provided in five bullet points below:

### **2. Code with comments and explanations:**
```c
#include <stdio.h>  // Preprocessor directive to include the standard input-output library

/*
* This program demonstrates how to use single and multi-line comments in C.
*/
int main() {  // Main function where program execution begins
    
    // The printf function is used to print the message on the screen.
    printf("Comments in C.\n");  // Prints the message "Comments in C." followed by a new line
    
    return 0;  // Returns 0 indicating that the program executed successfully
}
```

### **Five key points explained:**
1. `#include <stdio.h>`: This line includes the Standard Input/Output library, which is necessary for functions like `printf`.
2. **Multiline comment**: The multiline comment explains that this program demonstrates the use of single-line and multi-line comments.
3. **Main function**: `int main()` is the entry point of every C program. The code inside `main()` is executed when the program runs.
4. **`printf` function**: The `printf("Comments in C.\n");` statement prints a string message, "Comments in C." and moves to the next line with `\n`.
5. **Return statement**: `return 0;` indicates that the program has ended successfully. It returns 0 to the operating system.
