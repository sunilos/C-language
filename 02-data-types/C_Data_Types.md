### **1. Code without comments:**
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int myInt = 10;
    float myFloat = 3.14;
    char myChar = 'A';

    printf("Integer: %d, Float: %.2f, Char: %c\n", myInt, myFloat, myChar);

    return 0;
}
```

### **2. Code with comments and explanations:**
```c
#include <stdio.h>  // Includes the standard input-output library for input-output operations

int main() {  // Main function where program execution begins
    int myInt = 10;  // Declares an integer variable 'myInt' and assigns the value 10 to it
    float myFloat = 3.14;  // Declares a float variable 'myFloat' and assigns the value 3.14
    char myChar = 'A';  // Declares a character variable 'myChar' and assigns the value 'A'

    // Prints the values of myInt, myFloat, and myChar using format specifiers
    // %d for integers, %.2f for floats with two decimal precision, and %c for characters
    printf("Integer: %d, Float: %.2f, Char: %c\n", myInt, myFloat, myChar);

    return 0;  // Returns 0, indicating the program executed successfully
}
```

### Explanation

- The `#include <stdio.h>` directive includes the Standard I/O library, which provides functions like `printf` for output operations.
- The `main` function is the entry point of the program where execution begins.
- Three variables are declared and initialized: `myInt` (an integer), `myFloat` (a floating-point number), and `myChar` (a character).
- The `printf` function is used to print the values of these variables. `%d` is used for integers, `%.2f` formats the floating-point number to two decimal places, and `%c` is used for characters.
- The program ends with `return 0;`, indicating that it has executed successfully and returns control to the operating system.
