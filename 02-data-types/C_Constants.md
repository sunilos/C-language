I apologize for that oversight. Here are the two versions of the code:

### **1. Code without comments:**
```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define PI 3.14159

int main() {
    printf("PI value: %f\n", PI);
    return 0;
}
```

### **2. Code with comments and explanations:**
```c
#include <stdio.h>  // Includes the standard input-output library

#define PI 3.14159  // Defines a constant PI with the value 3.14159

int main() {  // Main function where the program starts executing
    printf("PI value: %f\n", PI);  // Prints the value of PI using the %f format specifier for floating-point numbers
    return 0;  // Returns 0, indicating that the program has run successfully
}
```

### Explanation

- The `#include <stdio.h>` directive includes the Standard I/O library, which provides the `printf` function used for output operations.
- The `#define PI 3.14159` directive creates a constant named `PI` with a value of `3.14159`. This constant can be used throughout the program in place of the literal value.
- The `main` function is the starting point of program execution. Within this function, `printf` is used to output the value of the `PI` constant.
- The `printf("PI value: %f\n", PI);` statement prints the value of `PI`. The `%f` format specifier is used to display floating-point numbers.
- The program concludes with `return 0;`, indicating that the program has executed successfully and returns control to the operating system.
