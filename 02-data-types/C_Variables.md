### **1. Code without comments:**
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int myVar = 5;
    printf("Variable value: %d\n", myVar);
    return 0;
}
```

### **2. Code with comments and explanations:**
```c
#include <stdio.h>

/**
 * @brief The main function demonstrates basic variable usage and printing in C.
 * 
 * This function initializes an integer variable, assigns it a value, and prints that value.
 * 
 * @return int Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
 */
int main() {
    int myVar = 5;  /**< Integer variable initialized with the value 5. */

    // Print the value of the integer variable
    printf("Variable value: %d\n", myVar);

    return 0;   /**< Return 0 to indicate successful execution. */
}
```

### Explanation

- The `#include <stdio.h>` directive includes the Standard I/O library, which is necessary for using the `printf` function.
- The `main` function is the starting point of the program where execution begins.
- An integer variable `myVar` is declared and initialized with the value `5`.
- The `printf` function is used to print the value of `myVar`. The `%d` format specifier is used to display integer values.
- The program concludes with `return 0;`, which signifies that the program has completed successfully and returns control to the operating system.
