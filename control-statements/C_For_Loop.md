Here's the updated code with comments and explanations:

```c
#include <stdio.h>  // Includes the standard input-output library for input-output operations

int main() {  // Main function where program execution starts
    // A for loop that iterates from 0 to 4 (5 iterations in total)
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        // Prints the value of 'i' in each iteration
        printf("i: %d\n", i);  // %d is the format specifier for integers
    }

    return 0;  // Returns 0 to indicate successful program execution
}
```

### Explanation:
- **`for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)`**: This is a `for` loop that initializes the variable `i` to 0, checks the condition `i < 5`, and increments `i` after each iteration.
  - **Initialization**: `int i = 0` initializes the loop counter `i` to 0.
  - **Condition**: `i < 5` ensures the loop runs as long as `i` is less than 5.
  - **Increment**: `i++` increases the value of `i` by 1 after each iteration.
- **`printf("i: %d\n", i);`**: Inside the loop, the current value of `i` is printed on each iteration. The `%d` format specifier is used to print the integer value of `i`.
- **`return 0;`**: This returns 0 to indicate that the program has executed successfully.

This program demonstrates how a `for` loop works by printing the values of `i` from 0 to 4. Each iteration prints the current value of `i`, which increases by 1 after each loop iteration.
