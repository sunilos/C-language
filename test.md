Here's the updated code with comments and explanations:

```c
#include <stdio.h>  // Includes the standard input-output library for input-output operations

int main() {  // Main function where the program execution begins
    // Prints the message "This is an example of output in C." to the console
    printf("This is an example of output in C.\n");  // %s is not needed as it's a direct string literal

    return 0;  // Returns 0, indicating successful program execution
}
```

### Explanation:
- **`#include <stdio.h>`**: This includes the standard input-output library which provides functions like `printf` for outputting data to the console.
- **`int main()`**: The `main` function is the starting point of the program where execution begins.
- **`printf("This is an example of output in C.\n");`**: The `printf` function is used to print the string `"This is an example of output in C."` followed by a newline character (`\n`). The newline character moves the cursor to the next line after printing.
- **`return 0;`**: This statement indicates that the program executed successfully and returns 0 to the operating system.

This program provides a basic demonstration of how to use the `printf` function to display output in C. It's a simple example for learning the syntax of output statements.
