### **1. Code without comments:**
```c
#include <stdio.h>

enum Day {SUNDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY};

int main() {
    enum Day today = WEDNESDAY;
    printf("Day number: %d\n", today);
    return 0;
}
```

### **2. Code with comments and explanations:**
```c
#include <stdio.h>  // Includes the standard input-output library for input-output functions

// Define an enumeration type 'Day' with values representing days of the week
enum Day {SUNDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY};

int main() {  // Main function where the program execution begins
    // Declare a variable 'today' of type 'enum Day' and initialize it to 'WEDNESDAY'
    enum Day today = WEDNESDAY;
    
    // Print the integer value associated with 'today' using %d format specifier
    printf("Day number: %d\n", today);

    return 0;  // Return 0 to indicate successful program execution
}
```

### Explanation:

- `#include <stdio.h>` includes the functions necessary for input and output operations.
- `enum Day {SUNDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY};` defines an enumeration named `Day` with integer values corresponding to the days of the week. By default, `SUNDAY` is 0, `MONDAY` is 1, and so on.
- `enum Day today = WEDNESDAY;` declares a variable `today` of type `enum Day` and initializes it to `WEDNESDAY`. In this enumeration, `WEDNESDAY` is represented by the integer value 3.
- `printf("Day number: %d\n", today);` prints the integer value associated with `today`, which will be `3` in this case. The `%d` format specifier is used to print integer values.
- `return 0;` returns 0 from `main` to indicate that the program executed successfully.
