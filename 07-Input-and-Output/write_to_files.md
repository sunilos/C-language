### **1. Code without comments:**
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    FILE *file = fopen("example.txt", "w");
    if (file == NULL) {
        printf("Failed to open file.\n");
        return 1;
    }
    fprintf(file, "Hello, File!\n");
    fclose(file);
    return 0;
}
```

### **2. Code with comments and explanations:**
```c
#include <stdio.h>  // Includes the standard input-output library for file operations

int main() {  // Main function where the program execution begins
    // Opens the file "example.txt" for writing. If the file doesn't exist, it will be created.
    FILE *file = fopen("example.txt", "w");
    
    // Check if the file was successfully opened
    if (file == NULL) {
        // If file opening fails, print an error message and return 1
        printf("Failed to open file.\n");
        return 1;  // Return 1 to indicate an error
    }

    // Write the string "Hello, File!" to the file
    fprintf(file, "Hello, File!\n");

    // Close the file to ensure that all data is flushed and resources are freed
    fclose(file);

    return 0;  // Return 0 to indicate successful program execution
}
```

### Explanation:

- `#include <stdio.h>` includes the functions necessary for file handling.
- `FILE *file = fopen("example.txt", "w");` attempts to open "example.txt" for writing. If the file does not exist, it will be created. If the file cannot be opened, `file` will be `NULL`.
- `if (file == NULL)` checks if the file was opened successfully. If not, it prints an error message and returns `1`.
- `fprintf(file, "Hello, File!\n");` writes the string "Hello, File!" to the file. The `fprintf` function is used to format and write data to the file.
- `fclose(file);` closes the file after writing to ensure that all data is flushed to the file and to free up system resources.
