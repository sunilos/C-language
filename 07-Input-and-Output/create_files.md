### **1. Code without comments:**
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    FILE *file = fopen("example.txt", "w");
    
    if (file == NULL) {
        printf("Failed to create file.\n");
        return 1;
    }

    printf("File created successfully.\n");

    fclose(file);

    return 0;
}
```

### **2. Code with comments and explanations:**
```c
#include <stdio.h>  // Includes the standard input-output library for input-output operations

int main() {  // Main function where program execution begins
    // Declare a pointer 'file' of type FILE and attempt to open "example.txt" for writing
    FILE *file = fopen("example.txt", "w");
    
    // Check if the file was successfully created and opened
    if (file == NULL) {
        // If file creation fails, print an error message and return 1 to indicate failure
        printf("Failed to create file.\n");
        return 1;  // Return 1 to indicate an error
    }

    // If the file was created successfully, print a success message
    printf("File created successfully.\n");

    // Close the file to free up resources
    fclose(file);

    return 0;  // Return 0 to indicate successful program execution
}
```

### Explanation:

- `#include <stdio.h>` includes the functions needed for file operations.
- `FILE *file = fopen("example.txt", "w");` opens a file named "example.txt" for writing. If the file doesn't exist, it will be created.
- `if (file == NULL)` checks if the file creation failed. If it did, an error message is printed and the program returns `1`.
- `printf("File created successfully.\n");` prints a success message when the file is created and opened without issues.
- `fclose(file);` closes the file once operations are complete.
